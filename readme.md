# Acknowledgements:

This project was originally just an employee employer review scraper for Indeed.com and Seek.com.au. At that
time, this project was inspired and to an extent guided by the work of tim-sauchuk on a now broken Indeed.com 
scrape tool.

Additionally, McJeffr provided very valuable feedback that greatly helped in guiding this project.

# Future:

Given this project was only developed for some research I have been conducting, future development of this tool is unlikely. If bugs are found, they will likely be fixed.

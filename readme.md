# Acknowledgements:

This project was originally just an employee employer review scraper for Indeed and Seek. At that time, this project was inspired and to an extent guided by the work of tim-sauchuk on a now broken Indeed.com scrape tool.

Additionally, McJeffr provided very valuable feedback that greatly helped in guiding this project.

# Future:

It is hoped this repository can serve as a robust framework that enables easier setup of reponsible scraping activities. We will continue to work on resolving bugs and improving the functionality of the core framework. Additionally, where appropriate, we will work to repair scrapers added to the official repository.
